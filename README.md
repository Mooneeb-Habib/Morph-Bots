A Final Year Project worked upon by 4 Electrical Engineering students from the batch of 2021 of Habib University.

Morph Bots is our attempt at creating programmable matter in its most simplest and basics of forms through the use of swarm robots called _Morph Bots_. Each Morph Bot is a small, autonomous robot that will work in tandemm with other Morph Bots to recreate a 3D Model which it will receive via any CAD Application.
